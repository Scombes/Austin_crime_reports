### Project Overview:
The aim of this project was to explore and analyze reported crimes in the City of Austin, TX, using data provided by the city.

### Data Processing:
The original data download contained over 22 million records. For this analysis, the focus was narrowed to the last seven years. The data was then cleaned and prepared for loading into a MYSQL Database. The date and datetime fields were formatted to work with MYSQL, and fields not needed for exploration were removed.

### Data Exploration:
A variety of queries and commands were utilized to further explore the data and identify key insights, which were then utilized to create informative and visually-appealing visualizations in Tableau.

### Key Findings:
- Reported crimes have been on a downward trend, with 91,483 crimes reported in 2021, compared to 107,054 in 2016. 
- "Family Disturbance" is the most common reported offense, with 69,469 reports since 2016, followed by "Burglary of Vehicle," with 60,899 reports. 
- Crimes Against Property make up 43.14% of all reported crimes. 
- "Theft Catalytic Converter" has seen a recent uptick in reports. 
- The majority of crimes occur at 12 AM and 12 PM, with the fewest reports at 5 AM.

### Recommendations:
Based on the findings, recommendations can be made to help combat specific types of crimes, such as burglaries of vehicles. These include increasing surveillance in high-risk areas, educating citizens on how to prevent this type of crime, warning citizens if they are in a high-risk area, and ensuring that adequate police officers are available during peak report times.

In addition, the results suggest that there should be increased police presence in the Downtown and North Lamar Rundberg Neighborhoods, which make up 11% of all reported crimes. It is also recommended that officers are adequately trained to handle "Family Disturbance" offenses, and that the City of Austin could consider using social workers in these instances.

### Tableau Visualization:
To facilitate communication of the findings, an interactive Tableau dashboard was created to provide easily understandable visualizations of the data.
